# xray-knife
Swiss army knife tool (cli) for [xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core).

**I DEDICATE THIS TOOL TO MY DEAR PERSIAN PEOPLE.**

**استفاده از این نرم افزار برای حمایت کنندگان جمهوری اسلامی حرام است.**

## Description
Since there was no existing program capable of directly checking xray-core config links in bulk, I took it upon myself to develop such a tool. I have now made it publicly available, enabling everyone to benefit from and enjoy its functionality. (`net http` command).
You can also benefit from other key features of this program, such as its rotating proxy functionality (`proxy` command).

You can view the flags of each command by using the `-h` or `--help` option.

## Features (main commands)
- `parse`: Detailed info about given xray config link.
- `subs`: Subscription management tool.
- `net`: Network testing tools for one or multiple xray configs.
- `scan`: Scanning tools needed for bypassing GFW (CF Scanner, REALITY Scanner).
- `proxy`: Creates proxy server to work as a client for xray-core configs.
